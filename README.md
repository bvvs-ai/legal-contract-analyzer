# AI Powered Legal Contract Analyzer: 1

The Main Aim pf the Project is to build an free and clean Artificial Intelligence system model to extract and analyze clauses in legal contracts using NLP(Natural Language Processing) and ML(Machine Learning Tools)
An open-source AI system designed to extract and analyze clauses in legal contracts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

## What is a Legal Contract Analyzer?

A legal contract analyzer is an AI-powered tool that helps users:

- Understand contract details
- Extract key information
- Identify potential risks
- Generate insights from complex legal documents

**Key Features:**
-Automation and Efficiency
-Risk Identification
-Clause Extraction
-Smart Search and Querying
-AI-Powered Insights
-Cost and Time Savings

**How it works:**

- Extracts key information and entities
- Summarizes content
- Identifies risks and opportunities
- Detects inconsistencies
- Supports automated workflows

## AI Techniques Used

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?

ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. It's widely used for predictions, classifications, and decision-making.

### What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language — making legal text understandable to machines.

## Tools & Techniques Used in Contract Analysis

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **Text Understanding:** Parsing legal jargon and structure
- **Semantic Analysis:** Understanding context and clause intent
- **Entity Recognition:** Extracting names, dates, amounts
- **Sentiment Detection:** Identifying negative or risky tones

### 2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**

- **Clause Classification**
- **Risk Prediction**
- **Pattern Recognition**
- **Summarization**

### 3. **Other Technologies**

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** To handle scanned contracts
- **Vector Databases:** For semantic search and clause matching
